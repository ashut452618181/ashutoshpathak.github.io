This project is a comprehensive Data Cleaning and Analysis endeavor focused on the global trend of layoffs within the tech industry
The primary objective was to transform a raw, unstructured dataset into a clean, reliable, and query-friendly format suitable for deeper analysis.

This effort utilized advanced SQL techniques for data manipulation, cleaning, and subsequent analysis to uncover significant patterns.

Key skills demonstrated include Advanced SQL Querying, Handling Missing Values (Imputation/Removal), Data Standardization, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The core methodology involved rigorous data cleaning, such as resolving missing values in layoff and financial metrics, standardizing text fields like location and industry, and ensuring correct date formatting.

Complex SQL queries were executed to derive meaningful insights, including analyzing layoff trends over time, identifying the most affected industries and countries, and exploring the correlation between company funding stage and layoff severity.

The final output, sql project(Data cleaning) results.csv, represents a fully cleaned and trustworthy dataset ready for advanced business intelligence and visualization.
